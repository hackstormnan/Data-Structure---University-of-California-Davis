In my projects, I delve into the implementation and exploration of AVL and BST structures. These data structures, namely AVL tree and Binary Search Tree, are widely used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. By understanding the intricacies of AVL and BST, I aim to optimize the performance of these structures. This involves studying their balancing mechanisms, height properties, and various traversal algorithms. Through this exploration, I gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of AVL and BST and how they can be effectively utilized in different applications.
