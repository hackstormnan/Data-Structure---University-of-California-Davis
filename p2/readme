In my projects, I explore and compare the performance of different sorting algorithms. I analyze their time complexity, which refers to the execution time, and space complexity, which relates to the memory requirements. By evaluating various sorting techniques like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort, I aim to identify the most efficient algorithm for different scenarios. Considerations such as time and space complexity play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a sorting algorithm for a given project.
